[New Challenges and New Opportunities for the Federal Statistical System]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/docs/2023-conference-docs/Plenary_Abraham.pdf){:target="_blank"}  
Katharine G. Abraham, *University of Maryland*

Approaching the five-year anniversary of the signing of the Evidence Act, the Federal statistical system faces many challenges but also an exciting new set of opportunities. Under the Act, statistical agency leaders are being asked to play an expanded role as stewards of the data held by the Federal government. Working together and with the government’s program agencies—and, in some cases, with holders of private sector data—the agencies can help to better meet the growing demand for reliable information about our society and economy and about the effectiveness of policy interventions to address societal concerns. Embracing these opportunities will increase the agencies’ relevance in a rapidly changing world and position the federal statistical system well for the coming decades.

**Katharine G. Abraham** is a Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland. Her published research includes papers on the work and retirement decisions of older Americans; how government policies affect employers’ choices concerning employment and hours over the business cycle; the effects of financial aid on the decision to attend college; discrepancies in alternative measures of employment, wages and hours; and the measurement of economic activity. She served as Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 1993 through 2001 and as a Member of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers from 2011 through 2013. Abraham currently serves on standing academic advisory committees convened by the Congressional Budget Office, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. She is a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research and a Research Fellow of the IZA, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association, and an elected Fellow of the American Statistical Association and of the Society of Labor Economists. Abraham received her Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1982 and her B.S. in economics from Iowa State University in 1976.
