[Federal Statistics: Building on the Past, Looking to the Future - Check url]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/docs/2023-conference-docs/Plenary_Mulrow.pdf){:target="_blank"}  
Jeri Mulrow, *Westat*  
Federal Statistics are vitally useful providing important measures of our society across all aspects of our lives. They have been, are, and will continue to be used for evidence-based decision making. Unfortunately, they are often invisible and taken for granted by the general public who often have no idea where the information comes from, by Congress who has held appropriations constant for many Federal Statistical agencies, and even by many departments of our Federal Government who house these important statistical units. Regardless, the producers of Federal Statistics continue to build on the past and look to the future. 

Jeri Mulrow is Vice President and Sector Lead, Data Solutions, leading Westat’s units of Statistics and Data Science, Large Surveys, Research Operations, and Field Services staff, overseeing the collaboration of these teams’ shared processes to promote efficiency and facilitate innovative research solutions. From 2019 to 2023, she served as Director of Statistics and Data Science. Her areas of statistical expertise include sampling and estimation methodologies, survey methodology and design, data quality and process improvement, and data visualization and information dissemination.
