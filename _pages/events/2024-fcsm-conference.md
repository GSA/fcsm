Karin Orvis, _Office of Management and Budget_  
Dr. Karin A. Orvis currently serves as the Chief Statistician of the United States, in the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). In this capacity, Dr. Orvis is responsible for leading and coordinating the U.S. Federal Statistical System to ensure it provides impartial, trusted U.S. Federal statistics foundational to informing decisions across the public and private sectors. Dr. Orvis also oversees implementation of OIRA’s science policy responsibilities, and is charged with ensuring the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of the information disseminated by Federal agencies and used in decision-making. Prior to her current role, Dr. Orvis served in senior executive-level roles across the U.S. Federal Government, strategically leading multidisciplinary, interagency teams in designing, implementing, and evaluating enterprise-wide policies and programs.

[Federal Statistics: Building on the Past, Looking to the Future - Check url]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/docs/2023-conference-docs/Plenary_Mulrow.pdf){:target="\_blank"}  
Jeri Mulrow, _Westat_  
Federal Statistics are vitally useful providing important measures of our society across all aspects of our lives. They have been, are, and will continue to be used for evidence-based decision making. Unfortunately, they are often invisible and taken for granted by the general public who often have no idea where the information comes from, by Congress who has held appropriations constant for many Federal Statistical agencies, and even by many departments of our Federal Government who house these important statistical units. Regardless, the producers of Federal Statistics continue to build on the past and look to the future.

Jeri Mulrow is Vice President and Sector Lead, Data Solutions, leading Westat’s units of Statistics and Data Science, Large Surveys, Research Operations, and Field Services staff, overseeing the collaboration of these teams’ shared processes to promote efficiency and facilitate innovative research solutions. From 2019 to 2023, she served as Director of Statistics and Data Science. Her areas of statistical expertise include sampling and estimation methodologies, survey methodology and design, data quality and process improvement, and data visualization and information dissemination.
