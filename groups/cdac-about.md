<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>CDAC was the first interest group of OMB's Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology (FCSM). The Confidentiality and Data Access Committee (CDAC) was formed for two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Staff members of Federal statistical agencies who work in the "confidentiality area" expressed a need to have a forum where they could communicate among themselves, discuss disclosure limitation methods, and exchange ideas.</li>
<li>CDAC is a follow-on activity for the FCSM's Statistical Policy Working Paper # 22 (SPWP # 22), <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/docs/SPWP22_rev.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Report on Statistical Disclosure Limitation Methodology</em></a>.  </li><!-----------SPWP22_rev.pdf-->
</ol>
<p><strong>Membership:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The members of CDAC are federal employees of Executive Branch agencies and those administrative or independent agencies associated with the Executive Branch. These employees are responsible for (and/or working on) statistical disclosure limitation methods, administrative procedures for access to confidential statistical data, and members of their agency's Disclosure Review Board.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
