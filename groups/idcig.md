<p>Adaptive or responsive survey design refers to the use of paradata and other auxiliary data to make strategic decisions about the allocation of resources in data collection.  Adaptive design strategies may be used to manage costs, reduce non-response bias, or improve data quality.  Federal agencies have begun to experiment with adaptive design strategies and the research in this area has grown.  However, information about these activities is disperse and often difficult for survey practitioners to find. </p>
<p>This interest group is intended to provide a vehicle to share information about the use of adaptive design or other strategic management of data collection in Federal surveys and provide a forum for discussion of relevant topics. </p>
