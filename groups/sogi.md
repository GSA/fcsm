<p>The Measuring Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Research Group explores the best practices of the measurement of SOGI in the context of Federal information collections. The Group provides ongoing opportunities for individuals interested in statistical methods or data quality related to SOGI to interact, exchange information, and explore issues related to this topic.</p>

<p>Please contact the group chair(s) if you are a federal employee and interested in participating.</p>

(2021)</a> Some federal surveys collect data on the characteristics and well-being of sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. Inclusion of questions about sexual orientation (SO) and gender identity (GI) on federal surveys allows for better understanding of SGM populations relative to the general or other population groups, including economic, housing, health, and other differences. These insights can lead to potential resources and interventions needed to better serve the community. Further, these data meet critical needs to understand trends within larger population groups.  This FCSM brief describes what we have learned to date from federal surveys and federal efforts to develop effective survey questions.</li>

      In support of the need for further research on the terminology and ordering of response options for sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) questions, this paper highlights insights identified in recent literature reviewed about response option terminology and associated methodological implications. The paper contributes to the broader discussion of measuring SOGI in surveys and identifies possible future research avenues for documenting best practices for SOGI measurement.</li>
