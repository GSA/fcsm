<p>The Confidentiality and Data Access Committee (CDAC) is an FCSM interest group focusing on issues related to statistical disclosure limitation (de-identification) and controlled access to confidential data. CDAC's membership primarily includes federal employees from across government who manage their agencies' Disclosure Review Boards and tiered-data access programs. CDAC serves as an information-sharing forum to foster collaboration on current research activities, to explore new research ideas, and to provide assistance to agencies across government on confidentiality and data access issues</p>
<p>CDAC is sponsored by the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology to provide a forum for staff members of Federal statistical agencies who work on confidentiality and data access topics to communicate among themselves, exchange ideas, etc.</p>
