<p>The Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Sex Characteristics (SOGISC) Subcommittee promotes coordination between federal agencies on issues relating to measuring sexual orientation and gender identity in federal data collections.</p>

<p>The SOGISC Subcommittee advises the FCSM and the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP) on SOGISC measurement issues, provides technical assistance as needed across Federal agencies on SOGISC measurement issues, and oversees meetings of the FCSM <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/groups/sogisc-ig/">Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Sex Characteristics (SOGISC) Interest Group</a>.</p>

(2021)</a> Some federal surveys collect data on the characteristics and well-being of sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. Inclusion of questions about sexual orientation (SO) and gender identity (GI) on federal surveys allows for better understanding of SGM populations relative to the general or other population groups, including economic, housing, health, and other differences. These insights can lead to potential resources and interventions needed to better serve the community. Further, these data meet critical needs to understand trends within larger population groups.  This FCSM brief describes what we have learned to date from federal surveys and federal efforts to develop effective survey questions.</li>

      In support of the need for further research on the terminology and ordering of response options for sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) questions, this paper highlights insights identified in recent literature reviewed about response option terminology and associated methodological implications. The paper contributes to the broader discussion of measuring SOGI in surveys and identifies possible future research avenues for documenting best practices for SOGI measurement.</li>
