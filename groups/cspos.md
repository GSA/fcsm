<p>The purpose of this interest group (previously, the Computational Statistics and the Production of
Official Statistics Interest Group) is to share information on data science methods and uses across
federal agencies. These applications are broad ranging, including the use of data science methods and
insights for the production of statistics and data products, for internal administrative activities of
agencies, and for research purposes. The interest group provides opportunities to identify areas of
common research, practice, and challenges, to coordinate collaborative research projects in those areas,
and to disseminate relevant information. Topics of growing interest machine learning methods and
natural language processing. A recurrent focus of the group's activities is organizing the GASP!
(Government Advances in Statistical Programming) conferences.</p>
<p><strong>DSFS Areas of Interest</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>New and emerging computational methods in statistics such a machine learning methods
and natural language processing.</li>
  <li>Training statistical and information technology staff on open-source programming
languages such a R and Python.</li>
  <li>Sharing best practices for implementation and maintenance of statistical software.</li>
  <li>Identifying opportunities for collaboration on statistical computing projects.</li>
</ul>
