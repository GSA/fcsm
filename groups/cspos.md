layout: page
sidenav: group_navigation
---
<p>The purpose of this interest group is to share information on computational statistics and the production of official statistics across federal agencies, to identify areas of common research, to coordinate collaborative research projects in those areas, and to disseminate information related to computational statistical methods and the implementation of these methods to produce official statistics</p>
