<p>The purpose of this interest group (previously, the Computational Statistics and the Production of
Official Statistics Interest Group) is to share information on data science methods and uses across
federal agencies. These applications are broad ranging, including the use of data science methods and
insights for the production of statistics and data products, for internal administrative activities of
agencies, and for research purposes. The interest group provides opportunities to identify areas of
common research, practice, and challenges, to coordinate collaborative research projects in those areas,
and to disseminate relevant information. Topics of growing interest machine learning methods and
natural language processing. A recurrent focus of the group's activities is organizing the GASP!
(Government Advances in Statistical Programming) conferences.</p>
